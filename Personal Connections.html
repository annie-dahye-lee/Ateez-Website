			As an Ateez fan myself, the members of the group are really special to me, even though many people think they're just idols.
			Whenever I listen to their music, it makes me happy, and cheers me up when I'm sad. Getting to know the members through watching videos and finding out more makes them seem more like real-life people I can relate and rely on.
