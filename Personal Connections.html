			<center>As an Ateez fan myself, the members of the group are really special to me, even though many people think they're just idols.
			Whenever I listen to their music, it makes me happy, cheers me up when I'm sad. Getting to know the members and finding out more about them makes them seem more like real-life people I can relate and rely on. They always inspire me to work harder, be kinder, be more confident, to love myself- they motivate me to become a better person.</center> </div>
